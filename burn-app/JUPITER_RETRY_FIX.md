# ✅ Jupiter API Retry Fix Complete!

## 🎯 **Problem Solved:**

The Jupiter API was failing with "fetch failed" errors due to network issues or API downtime.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Added Retry Logic**
- ✅ **3 Retry Attempts**: Automatically retries failed requests
- ✅ **2 Second Delays**: Waits between retry attempts  
- ✅ **Network Error Detection**: Specifically handles "fetch failed" errors
- ✅ **15 Second Timeout**: Longer timeout for slow responses

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- ✅ **Detailed Logging**: Shows attempt numbers and retry delays
- ✅ **Error Classification**: Distinguishes between network and API errors
- ✅ **Progressive Retries**: Each attempt is logged separately

## 🔄 **How It Works Now:**

### **Retry Process:**
```
Attempt 1: Jupiter API call
  ↓ (if fails)
Wait 2 seconds
  ↓
Attempt 2: Jupiter API call  
  ↓ (if fails)
Wait 2 seconds
  ↓
Attempt 3: Jupiter API call
  ↓ (if fails)
Wait 2 seconds
  ↓
Attempt 4: Jupiter API call
  ↓ (if fails)
❌ Final failure after 4 attempts
```

### **What You'll See:**
```
🔍 Getting Jupiter quote for Pump.fun token... (attempt 1/4)
❌ Jupiter quote failed (attempt 1): fetch failed
⚠️ Network error, retrying in 2 seconds...
🔍 Getting Jupiter quote for Pump.fun token... (attempt 2/4)
```

## 🚀 **Ready to Test:**

1. **Try the burn trigger again** - it will automatically retry
2. **Watch the logs** - you'll see retry attempts
3. **Be patient** - it will try 4 times total

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- **Network Issues**: Retry logic handles temporary network problems
- **API Downtime**: Retry logic handles Jupiter API downtime
- **Token Liquidity**: If token has no liquidity, it will fail after all retries
- **Real Transactions**: Only succeeds with real Jupiter API responses

## 🎉 **Result:**

- ✅ **Automatic Retries**: No more single-attempt failures
- ✅ **Better Reliability**: Handles temporary network issues
- ✅ **Real Transactions**: Still only executes real Jupiter swaps
- ✅ **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly what's happening

The burn app now has robust retry logic for Jupiter API calls! 🚀
