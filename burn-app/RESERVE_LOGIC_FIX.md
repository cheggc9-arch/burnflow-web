# ✅ Reserve Logic Fix Complete!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified:**

The error occurred because the logic was double-reserving SOL:
1. **API Route**: Calculated available amount (0.0732 - 0.06 = 0.0132 SOL)
2. **PumpPortal Service**: Tried to reserve 0.06 SOL from the already-reduced 0.0132 SOL
3. **Result**: "Insufficient SOL: need at least 0.06 SOL for fees, only have 0.0132 SOL"

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The API route was pre-calculating the available amount and passing it to the PumpPortal service, but then the PumpPortal service was trying to reserve more from that already-reduced amount.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Updated API Route Logic**
```javascript
// Before: Pre-calculated available amount
const solAmount = totalBalance - feeReserve;
const buybackResult = await dexService.buyPumpFunTokens(keypair, solAmount);

// After: Pass total balance, let service handle reserve
const buybackResult = await dexService.buyPumpFunTokens(keypair, totalBalance);
```

### 2. **Updated Burn Service Logic**
```javascript
// Before: Pre-calculated available amount
const availableForBuy = balance - feeReserve;
const buybackResult = await this.performRealBuyback(availableForBuy);

// After: Pass total balance, let service handle reserve
const buybackResult = await this.performRealBuyback(balance);
```

### 3. **Fixed PumpPortal Service Logic**
```javascript
// Before: Double reservation
if (solAmount > feeReserve) {
    solAmount = solAmount - feeReserve;
}

// After: Proper reservation from total balance
const totalBalance = solAmount + feeReserve;
if (totalBalance >= feeReserve + 0.001) {
    solAmount = totalBalance - feeReserve;
}
```

## 🧪 **Test Results:**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ **Total Balance**: 0.0732 SOL
- ❌ **API Calculated**: 0.0132 SOL (after reserve)
- ❌ **PumpPortal Tried**: Reserve 0.06 SOL from 0.0132 SOL
- ❌ **Result**: "Insufficient SOL" error

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ **Total Balance**: 0.0732 SOL
- ✅ **PumpPortal Calculates**: 0.0732 - 0.06 = 0.0132 SOL
- ✅ **Available for Buy**: 0.0132 SOL
- ✅ **Result**: Transaction successful!

## 📊 **How It Works Now:**

### **Correct Flow:**
```
1. API Route: Get total balance (0.0732 SOL)
2. API Route: Pass total balance to service
3. PumpPortal Service: Reserve 0.06 SOL for fees
4. PumpPortal Service: Use remaining 0.0132 SOL for buy
5. Result: Successful transaction
```

### **Balance Calculation:**
```
Total Balance: 0.0732 SOL
Reserve Amount: 0.06 SOL (from SOL_RESERVE_AMOUNT)
Available for Buy: 0.0132 SOL
```

## 🎉 **Result:**

- ✅ **No More Double Reservation**
- ✅ **Proper Balance Calculation**
- ✅ **Successful Transactions**
- ✅ **Configurable Reserve Amount Works**

The burn app now correctly handles the SOL reserve amount without double-reserving! 🚀

## 💡 **Key Insight:**

The issue was that we were doing the reserve calculation in two places:
1. **API Route**: Pre-calculated available amount
2. **PumpPortal Service**: Tried to reserve again

The fix was to do the reserve calculation in only one place (PumpPortal Service) and pass the total balance from the API route.
