# 🔍 Jupiter API Issue Debug

## 🎯 **Problem Identified:**

The Jupiter API is currently returning "fetch failed" errors, which indicates:
1. **Network connectivity issues** - Jupiter API might be down
2. **Token liquidity issues** - Pump.fun token might not have liquidity on Jupiter
3. **API endpoint issues** - Jupiter API might have changed

## 🔧 **What I've Implemented:**

### 1. **Retry Logic**
- ✅ **3 Retry Attempts**: Automatically retries failed requests
- ✅ **2 Second Delays**: Waits between retry attempts
- ✅ **Network Error Detection**: Specifically handles "fetch failed" errors
- ✅ **15 Second Timeout**: Longer timeout for slow responses

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- ✅ **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly what's failing
- ✅ **Error Classification**: Distinguishes between network and API errors
- ✅ **Retry Information**: Shows attempt numbers and delays

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **Option 1: Wait and Retry**
The retry logic should handle temporary Jupiter API issues. Try the burn trigger again - it will automatically retry 3 times.

### **Option 2: Check Token Liquidity**
Your Pump.fun token might not have liquidity on Jupiter. Check:
1. Go to [Jupiter](https://jup.ag) website
2. Try swapping SOL to your token manually
3. If it doesn't work, the token might not be listed on Jupiter

### **Option 3: Alternative DEX Integration**
If Jupiter continues to fail, we can implement:
- **Raydium API** integration
- **Orca API** integration
- **Direct Pump.fun integration**

## 🔍 **Debug Information:**

**Current Token**: `Ej8FUr9Sjn3Qwf77gzrLyCyu1EFq2K8UdV2fqYytpump`
**Jupiter URL**: `https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/quote`
**Error**: `fetch failed`

## ⚠️ **Immediate Action:**

1. **Try the burn trigger again** - the retry logic should help
2. **Check your internet connection**
3. **Wait a few minutes** - Jupiter API might be temporarily down
4. **Verify token address** - make sure it's correct

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

With the retry logic, you should see:
```
🔍 Getting Jupiter quote for Pump.fun token... (attempt 1/4)
❌ Jupiter quote failed (attempt 1): fetch failed
⚠️ Network error, retrying in 2 seconds...
🔍 Getting Jupiter quote for Pump.fun token... (attempt 2/4)
```

The system will automatically retry up to 3 times before giving up.
